# Cricket Analytics using Python and PowerBI
Over the past decade, the adoption of analytics has significantly improved results across all sports. In this project, we aim to replicate how computer analysts working with IPL teams identify the best batsmen and bowlers for their team. Data analysis assists IPL teams in answering crucial questions such as: “Should they invest in a particular player or not?” and “How valuable will the player be for the team?” It also helps them determine in detail, “Which player should they buy and which one should they avoid?”, “How much should they spend on each player?” and “What are the values of the different players?”

Remarkably, IPL teams have begun using data analysis for these purposes.
### Problem Statement
The owners and the management of Mumbai Indians want to identify the best possible players suitable for them for the next auction. They have hired you as an Analyst to help them identify the best IPL team for the 2022 auction. You need to analyze the IPL data from 2008 to 2020, and perform the following tasks:
- Rank batsmen by year and overall based on ability
- Rank bowlers by year and overall based on ability
- Rank the most valuable player in IPL over all the years
- Visualize this in an intuitive Power BI Dashboards
- Find Similar Batsmen and Bowler
